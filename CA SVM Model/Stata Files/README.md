# Stata Files
Above are final dataset processors to generate 'test' and 'train' sets for the SVM ensemble. You will also find some work-in-progress files, including a specific work day's file. Normally, we would manually edit the Stata files if we wanted to do slight composition changes. For example, you will find the numbers 95 in front of many file names in other folders which indicates that the composition discarded 95% of negative-valued observations. This was done to avoid having the SVM always guess negative due to the disparity between the two groups.
